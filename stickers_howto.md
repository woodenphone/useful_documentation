# How to make stickers
### Assumptions
>Windows 10.
>Printer set up already - You can print from a PDF at the intended size. (PDF files contain info about the indended physical dimensions of the document.)
>Have Avery sticker sheets - Desktop A4 printer wither inkjet/laser depending on your printer.
>Plain printer paper to test your designs on. - (A4 or whatever size your sticker sheets are.)
>MS Word and MS Excel set up. (Other software exists but I have no experience to share for that.)


### Note on materials
It is strongly reccomended to buy name-brand stickers from an office supply company. While they cost more they can be trusted to work and templates are readily available. You can probably talk your way into getting help/support in using them as well.
I've bought the cheap no-brand ones myself and have yet to manage to print onto them right.

Creating a template alone would likely cost you more in time, hassle, and wasted materials than a a big ~$50.00 packet of name brand stickers.


Reccomended but ultimately optional:
1. Good set of scissors.
2. Craft / hobby knife with spare blades.
3. Metal ruler. (For straight cuts using a knife.)
4. Cutting mat. (For clean / neat  cuts using a knife.)
These are only needed if you want a special final sticker shape. (e.g. LTO casette labels.)


## Sticker sheet templates
Download them from the manufacturer. If you don't know the manufacturer then figure out how to measure the sheets you have and produce a template for them.

Stickers from the name brands should all come with a short product number that tells you what template to use.
e.g. 
>Avery, software code:"J8162", reorder number:"936029" - A4 sized sheets of 16x 99.1x34mm labels.
>Avery, software code:"J8167", reorder number:"936020" "" - A4 sized sheets of 1x 199.6x289.1mm labels.
>Avery, software code:"L7656", reorder number:"959018" "" - A4 sized sheets of 84x 46x11.1mm labels.
>Avery, software code:None listed, reorder number:"937104" - Roll of 500x 70x36mm labels.

## Producing sticker sheet document files
This can be done in a bulk manner using a technique known as a "mail merge". This involves preparing a spreadsheet of the information to put on each label, then importing that onto a template.
### Creating spreadsheet of sticker text
In MS Excel:
First row should be the names of each field (Value type information, ex. line1, line2; or name, addr1, addr2, city, postcode, state, country,...)
This first row is used later to arrange the data for formatting.
All rows following the first should be the information you want placed onto the labels.
Save your spreadsheet

### Mail merge
In MS Word:
Create a new blank document.
In the tool ribbon at the top use the mail merge option to begin
Select the spreadsheet you previously saved as the data source
Arrange the values on the first label (top left), this will be a template that spreads to all the other labels on the sheet.
Save as PDF for printing.

## Printing
### Printer setup
Print quality/detail

Paper size

Paper type

### Test print
Print at least one page of your stickers on plain paper as a test run to ensure your design fits the actual sticker sheet.
Mark one side of the page to identify the orientation the label sheets should be inserted. (Figure out if the front or back faces up in the tray)
Compare your test print to your sticker sheet to ensure that the design fits properly.
Look to see if design crosses past the edge of any sticker.
The alignment may drift from one end of the page to another, resulting in a ruined print batch.


### Actual print
Label sheets should be placed into the printer in the correct orientation so the stickers will be printed on.
Print using the settings described earlier.

## Reccomended products for specific uses
LTO Ultrium data tape casettes:
>Avery, software code:"L7656", reorder number:"959018" "" - A4 sized sheets of 84x 46x11.1mm labels.
Use a label generator tool to produce the design, then cut to final size & shape after printing.
