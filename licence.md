# License
Licensing is regarded as unimportant for the time being.
This can be figured out later if it ever becomes relevant.

For the more anal tyes, permission is granted to read, edit, and share this stuff for non-commercial educational puroses.

If you want to use this commercially you probably do not have the qualifications for your job, 
but I'll probably give permission.

No responsibility of any sort for anything is accepted or implied, even if otherwise implied or stated.

The terms of this license may be altered by me at any time past, present, or future, in any timeline, for any reason including "I felt like it, that's all the reason you're getting", or for no reason at all.

<Insert more bullshit legalese here>

SO SAYETH I.
