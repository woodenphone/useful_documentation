Things that might make a broken disk work.

# Flash
Flash drives (USB mass storage & SD cards mounted via USB-SD adaptor)

Files missing and replaced a generic file names something weird like "USBCU."
Try putting it in a linux box.
Putting the a micro sd card in a SD to USB adaptor and connecting that to a raspberry pi allowed me to recover the files from the device.

To wipe the bad drive for reuse:
fdisk to list devices, create new partition table, create a partition that fills the drive.



# Hard drives
Spinning platter magnetic boxes
