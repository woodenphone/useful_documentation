# Editing movies with Vegas Pro 14.0

Formerly available as part of a humble bundle


## Basic steps
You ideally want to be filming everything with the same settings so that you don't have to mess around editing out differences in settings.
If you use more than one device or more than one camera configuration I cannot help you.

1. Put videos on your computer
2. Copy videos into a new folder. This folder is your project folder.
3. Open Vegas, make a new project from the video files.
4. Watch the video clips in Vegas and tag them so you know what clip is what later. (bad, okay, good) (character names) (scene description), ect
5. Drag the best version of each clip into the timeline thing, starting with the earliest scene and continuing onwards
    As you add clips make sure you fix overlaps by dragging the new clips a bit to the right
6. Crop out bad bits. Keyboard shortcut to split a clip at the currently selected timepoint into two clips is 's'. Delete the one that needs removing and continue.

7. 


Fix audio levels to be consistant throughout movie
